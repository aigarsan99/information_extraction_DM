This codes were created for my master's thesis. The aim of this work is to apply deep learning and natural language processing techniques to extract information about diabetes mellitus from conversations between patients and a specialized chatbot. An attention modified encoder-decor Seq2seq model using bidirectional LSTM has been implemented and tuned for the extraction of information from up to thirteen different categories. This model has been trained and validated with a set of conversations elaborated for this study. To obtain it, a small public dataset was combined with another one generated from the information collected in a survey answered by diabetic people. After evaluation of the results obtained for each category, it has been concluded that, despite the limitations derived from the small data set, the model performs its task correctly, reaching an F1-score of 0.57 for the best model.
